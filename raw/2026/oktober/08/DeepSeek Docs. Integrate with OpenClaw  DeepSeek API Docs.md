## Integrate with OpenClaw

OpenClaw is an open-source personal AI assistant that can connect to popular chat tools like Feishu and WeChat, and can be extended through Skills.

## Migrate from Existing Installation to DeepSeek

If you already have OpenClaw installed, run the following command to re-enter the configuration phase and switch to the DeepSeek provider:

```markdown
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Then follow the prompts:

- When prompted: `I understand this is personal-by-default and shared/multi-user use requires lock-down. Continue?` Select **Yes**.
- When prompted: `Setup mode` It is recommended to select **QuickStart**.
- When prompted: `Model/auth provider` Select **DeepSeek**.
- When prompted: `Enter DeepSeek API key` Enter your [DeepSeek API Key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
- When prompted: `Default model` Navigate to **Enter model** and enter the model name (`deepseek-v4-pro` or `deepseek-v4-flash`).
- For the remaining configuration (message channels, Skills, etc.), configure as needed. Beginners can select **Skip for now**.
