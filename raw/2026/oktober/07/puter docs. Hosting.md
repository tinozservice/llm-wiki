## Hosting

---

The Puter.js Hosting API enables you to host files on the internet and manage your hosting programmatically.

The API provides comprehensive hosting management features including creating, retrieving, listing, updating, and deleting hostings. It is mainly used to expose files to the internet, where users can get their content from a public URL and additionally with these capabilities, you can host many applications, such as website builders, static site generators, or deployment tools that require programmatic control over hosting infrastructure.

    <script>
        (async () => {
            // (1) Create a random directory
            let dirName = puter.randName();
            await puter.fs.mkdir(dirName)

            // (2) Create 'index.html' in the directory with the contents "Hello, world!"
            await puter.fs.write(\`${dirName}/index.html\`, '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>');

            // (3) Host the directory under a random subdomain
            let subdomain = puter.randName();
            const site = await puter.hosting.create(subdomain, dirName)

            puter.print(\`Website hosted at: <a href="https://${site.subdomain}.puter.site" target="_blank">https://${site.subdomain}.puter.site</a>\`);
        })();
    </script>
</body>

#### Create 3 random websites and then list them

```html
<html>
<body>
    <script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>
    <script>
        (async () => {
            // (1) Generate 3 random subdomains
            let site_1 = puter.randName();
            let site_2 = puter.randName();
            let site_3 = puter.randName();

            // (2) Create 3 empty websites with the subdomains we generated
            await puter.hosting.create(site_1, '.');
            await puter.hosting.create(site_2, '.');
            await puter.hosting.create(site_3, '.');

            // (3) Get all subdomains
            let sites = await puter.hosting.list();

            // (4) Display the names of the websites
            puter.print(sites.map(site => site.subdomain));

            // Delete all sites (cleanup)
            await puter.hosting.delete(site_1);
            await puter.hosting.delete(site_2);
            await puter.hosting.delete(site_3);
        })();

<body>
    <script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>
    <script>
        (async () => {
            // (1) Create a random website
            let subdomain = puter.randName();
            const site = await puter.hosting.create(subdomain, '.')
            puter.print(\`Website hosted at: ${site.subdomain}.puter.site (This is an empty website with no files)<br>\`);

            // (2) Delete the website using delete()
            await puter.hosting.delete(site.subdomain);
            puter.print('Website deleted<br>');

            puter.print('Trying to retrieve website... (should fail)<br>');
            try {

            } catch (e) {
                puter.print('Website could not be retrieved<br>');

            const site2 = await puter.hosting.get(site.subdomain);
