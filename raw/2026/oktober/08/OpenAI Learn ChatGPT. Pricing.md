**ChatGPT Work and Codex share usage.** ChatGPT Work usage inside ChatGPT uses the same pricing, credits, and usage limits as Codex.

GPT-5.5 retires from ChatGPT, ChatGPT Work, and Codex on all plans on October 14, 2026. The OpenAI API isn’t affected. See [GPT-5.5 retirement](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models#gpt-55-retirement) for migration guidance.

See [token rates](#token-rates) for credit-based plans and [GPT-6.1 Sol model guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models#gpt-61-sol) for model details. API token prices are separate from subscription usage; don’t use them to estimate included tasks.

## Invite friends and coworkers

Eligible users can send Codex invitations from the profile menu in the lower-left corner of the app. Choose **Invite a friend** on an eligible personal plan or **Invite a coworker** in an eligible Business workspace, enter the recipient’s email address, and send the invitation.

The invitation dialog shows the current reward, recipient requirements, invite limits, and when rewards expire for your plan or promotion. Personal and Business referral programs have separate rewards and eligibility rules. Referrals aren’t currently available for ChatGPT Enterprise.

Business referrals use separate shared-workspace credit rewards; review the [current terms](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001271) before you send an invitation.

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the usage limits for my plan?

The number of messages you can send depends on the model used, size and complexity of your tasks, and whether you run them locally or in the cloud. Small scripts or routine functions may consume only a fraction of your allowance, while larger projects, long-running tasks, or extended sessions that require the agent to hold more context will use significantly more per message.

Tasks that look similar can consume different amounts of your allowance. Model choice, context, reasoning, tool use, retrieval, and caching all affect usage, so prompt length alone isn’t a reliable estimate.

For model recommendations, see [Models](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models).

The estimates below show local messages per five-hour period for Plus and Standard Business. Pro plans currently have no five-hour limit. Cloud tasks may use more of your allowance than local messages. Usage depends on the model and task. These estimates are not fixed message limits; check your [usage dashboard](#where-can-i-see-my-current-usage-limits) for current limits and reset times.

<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th><p>Plus</p></th><th><p>Standard Business</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPT-6 Astra</td><td>5-45</td><td>5-45</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-6.1 Sol</td><td>15-160</td><td>15-160</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-6 Sol</td><td>15-150</td><td>15-150</td></tr><tr><td>GPT-6 Luna</td><td>350-3,000</td><td>350-3,000</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td colspan="3"><p>Local messages and cloud chats share your plan’s usage allowance. Weekly limits may also apply.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>Enterprise/Edu users with flexible pricing have no fixed rate limits. Usage scales with <a href="#credits-overview">credits</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>Enterprise and Edu plans without flexible pricing have the same per-seat usage limits as Plus for most features.</p></td></tr></tfoot></table>

Usage limits are shared with other agentic features once pricing for those features is effective. This currently includes [ChatGPT for Excel](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001063) on Plus and Pro.

Fast and Ultrafast modes use included subscription limits and paid credits at different rates, relative to Standard mode for the same model:

| Speed mode | Included subscription usage | Purchased credits and Enterprise pay-as-you-go usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fast | 2.5x | 2x |
| GPT-6 Astra Ultrafast | 8x | 6x |

These billing multipliers don’t describe speed increases. Credit rates alone don’t determine how quickly you use included subscription limits; check your [usage dashboard](#where-can-i-see-my-current-usage-limits) for current limits and reset times. See [Speed](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed) for supported models and how speed modes affect usage.

Image generations use included limits ~3-5x faster on average, depending on image quality and size.

For GPT-6 Astra Ultrafast eligibility, billing, and administrator controls, see [Ultrafast mode](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed#ultrafast-mode).

### How much does Sites cost?

[Sites](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sites) is included with eligible ChatGPT plans during public beta. Availability depends on your plan, region, and workspace settings.

### How much does Voice cost?

Voice in Desktop uses your existing Codex usage budget at $0.05 per minute.

GPT-Live manages the live conversation. The model handling your task is billed separately at its applicable token rates. Voice and tasks share your plan’s usage limits.

For Business, Edu, and Enterprise workspaces with credit-based billing, desktop voice costs 1.25 credits per minute. This rate also applies when Plus and Pro users spend additional credits. ChatGPT Voice in Desktop isn’t available via API key.

### What happens when you hit usage limits?

We want you to be able to complete work already in progress. If you reach your usage limits during an active turn, the agent will be able to continue working on that turn, subject to fair use limits.

ChatGPT Plus and Pro users who reach their usage limit can purchase additional credits to continue working without needing to upgrade their existing plan.

Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans with [flexible pricing](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-the-enterprise-edu-and-business-plans) can purchase additional workspace credits to continue working.

All users may also run extra local chats using an API key, with usage charged at [standard API rates](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

### How does image generation count toward usage limits?

Image generation counts toward the same general usage limits as local messages and cloud chats. Image generations use included limits 3-5x faster on average than similar turns without image generation, depending on image quality and size. After you reach your included limits, image generation also draws from [credits](#credits-overview).

Image generation isn’t available on the Free plan. When you use Codex with an API key, API pricing applies to image generation instead of included ChatGPT usage limits.

### Where can I see my current usage limits?

You can find your current limits in the [usage dashboard](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/usage). If you want to see your remaining limits during an active Codex CLI session, you can use `/status`.

Check the dashboard every week or two to understand your pace and remaining capacity. If usage is higher than expected, consider whether a smaller model or tighter task scope would still produce a useful result.

### What are tokens and credits?

Tokens are small units of information that ChatGPT reads and writes. Your prompt, files, chat history, tool results, and ChatGPT’s response all use tokens.

Credits are the unit used to pay for eligible usage on credit-based plans. After you reach your included limits, available credits let you continue working. Credit purchase prices and applicable discounts depend on your plan or agreement.

#### Token rates

The rates below are for Standard speed, quoted in credits per million input tokens, cached input tokens, and output tokens. [Learn more about tokens](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).

Codex credit billing has no separate cache-write charge. API-key usage follows [API pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/api/docs/pricing).

GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna rates remain unchanged. Credit prices alone don’t determine included subscription usage; check your [usage dashboard](#where-can-i-see-my-current-usage-limits) for current limits.

A small subset of Enterprise customers should continue using the legacy rate card until we migrate you to the new token-based pricing. For more information, [contact OpenAI sales](https://chatgpt.com/contact-sales?utm_internal_source=openai_developers_codex).

[Learn more about credits in ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Edu.](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-the-enterprise-edu-and-business-plans)

For Business and Enterprise/Edu credit billing, use the [credit-based rate card](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11481834-chatgpt-rate-card-business-enterpriseedu-credit-based-pricing). If your Enterprise agreement specifies usage-based billing in USD, use the [Enterprise USD rate card](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001415-chatgpt-rate-card-enterprise-token-based-pricing) and your agreement instead. Workspace administrators can also review [ChatGPT Work usage and cost](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/chatgpt-work-usage-and-cost#understand-tokens-and-credits).

### What counts as Code Review usage?

Code Review usage applies only when Codex runs reviews through GitHub, for example, when you tag `@Codex` for review in a pull request or enable automatic reviews on your repository. Reviews run locally or outside of GitHub count toward your general usage limits.

### What can I do to make my usage limits last longer?

The local-message counts above are estimates; the token table lists credit rates per million tokens. To make your usage allowance last longer, try these tips:

- **Control the size of your prompts.** Be precise with the instructions you give the agent, but remove unnecessary context.
- **Limit source material.** Provide only relevant files and, when possible, narrow the sources or date range.
- **Match the output to the need.** Define the audience, format, and length, and separate required work from optional improvements.
- **Reduce the size of your AGENTS.md.** If you work on a larger project, you can control how much context you inject through AGENTS.md files by [nesting them within your repository](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md#layer-project-instructions).
- **Limit the number of MCP servers you use.** Every [MCP](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp) server adds more context to your messages and uses more of your limit. Disable MCP servers when you don’t need them.

## Feature availability

In ChatGPT, GPT-6.1 Sol is available in Work and Codex, not Chat. For Enterprise and Edu, the model is off by default until an administrator enables it. Using it in ChatGPT Work or Codex also requires access to the respective surface. API-key access follows API model availability.
