### When to consider GPT-6.1 Sol

Consider GPT-6.1 Sol for complex projects where cost matters, such as creating a board presentation from financial results or building a website from a product brief. Compare it with Astra on the same task to assess the tradeoff between quality and cost.

See the [API model page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6.1-sol) for specifications and API pricing, or [Codex and ChatGPT Work availability](https://developers.openai.com/codex/models#gpt-6.1-sol) for access through your ChatGPT plan.

## How to think about models and reasoning effort

Luna is the most cost-efficient model, while Astra is our state-of-the-art, most powerful model. If cost and latency aren’t a concern, you can default to Astra. To reduce costs or latency, use the guidance below to choose a model and reasoning effort for your needs.

Model and reasoning effort

1. Luna · Low
	Fine-grained edits, well-scoped problem-solving, and simple data extraction.
2. Luna · Extra high
	Finding current context across multiple apps, prioritizing work, and solving problems with clear constraints.
3. GPT-6.1 Sol · Medium
	Complex technical work and coordinated deliverables you expect to revise.
4. GPT-6.1 Sol · Extra high
	Polished deliverables, connected visual systems, and decisions built from conflicting evidence.
5. Astra · Low
	Concise writing and content adaptation that preserve facts and nuance.
6. Astra · Medium
	Ambitious projects that need broad context, reliable interactions, and complete results.
7. Astra · Extra high
	Demanding analysis and complex deliverables with exacting requirements.

### Experiment

Treat the guidance on this page as a starting point. The best way to find the right model for your workflow is to experiment with different models and reasoning settings to see what works.

Start by considering:

- **How often does your workflow run?** A frequent automation makes usage and cost add up faster than an occasional project.
- **How quickly do you need the result?** A task you’re waiting on may need a faster setting than one that runs overnight.
- **How will you use the output?** A draft for your review may need less polish than something you’ll share externally.
- **How important is the quality of the result?** Depending on your use case or industry, you might want to use a stronger model to put an emphasis on quality.

If you can, experiment using the same inputs to compare results and keep the lightest setting that meets your quality bar.
