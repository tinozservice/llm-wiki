## GPT-5.5 retirement

On October 14, 2026, GPT-5.5 will retire from ChatGPT, ChatGPT Work, and Codex on all plans, including consumer, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans. This retirement does not apply to the OpenAI API.

If you use Codex with ChatGPT sign-in, choose an available replacement before October 14:

- On Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans, choose **GPT-6 Sol** (`gpt-6-sol`) when available.
- On Free and Go plans, choose **GPT-6 Luna** (`gpt-6-luna`) in the desktop app when available.

Replace `gpt-5.5` in workspace defaults, saved model settings, managed configurations, custom agents, scheduled tasks, and scripts that select a model.

See [workspace model availability](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/workspace-model-availability#prepare-for-the-gpt-55-retirement) for administrator guidance.

## Choose a model

In Work or Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app, use the model and reasoning control beneath the composer to choose an available model and adjust its reasoning effort.

Higher reasoning effort can improve results for complex tasks, but it takes longer and uses more tokens. Start with the default effort and increase it when the task needs deeper planning or analysis.

**Ultra** mode goes beyond a single-agent run. It uses [subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents) to accelerate complex work, making it useful for larger tasks that can be split across subagents.

## Recommended models

For complex coding and agentic workflows, use GPT-6.1 Sol when available to your account and client. Use Luna for focused, repeatable tasks. Select `gpt-6.1-sol` or `gpt-6-luna` in your model picker or saved configuration when available.

GPT-6.1 Sol offers near-Astra performance for complex work at a lower cost than Astra. See [GPT-6.1 Sol](#app-gpt-61-sol) for its separate rollout.

In ChatGPT, GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Sol, and GPT-6 Luna are available in Work and Codex. They aren’t available in Chat.

GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Luna remain available during the rollout. Selecting a new model doesn’t change workspace permissions or grant access to it.

For Astra Ultrafast availability and credit usage on Pro $500 and eligible Enterprise and Edu plans, see [Speed](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed#ultrafast-mode).

Availability depends on the rollout, your sign-in method, and your client. See [pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) for plan access and usage, and [workspace model availability](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/workspace-model-availability) for Enterprise access.

### GPT-6.1 Sol

The GPT-6.1 Sol launch rollout includes Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu in Codex in the desktop app and CLI, and ChatGPT Work on the web and mobile. For Enterprise and Edu, the plan keeps GPT-6.1 Sol off by default until an administrator enables it. Free and Go are not included at launch.

Standard and Fast modes are available at launch. Ultrafast support for GPT-6.1 Sol is coming later.

Use `gpt-6.1-sol`. Available controls depend on your plan, client, and workspace settings. Reasoning effort ranges from Light to Ultra. Max and Ultra depend on your settings.

See [pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) for credit usage and [model selection](https://learn.chatgpt.com/api/docs/guides/model-selection#when-to-consider-gpt-61-sol) for guidance on comparing it with Astra and Luna. To see how its API specifications differ from the previous Sol model, [compare GPT-6.1 Sol and GPT-6 Sol](https://learn.chatgpt.com/api/docs/models/compare?model=gpt-6.1-sol&model2=gpt-6-sol).

In the ChatGPT desktop app and ChatGPT Work on the web, start with the default Power setting available to your account. Move toward **Smarter** for deeper reasoning or **Faster** for faster, lower-cost work. Open **Advanced** to choose a specific model, reasoning effort, or speed.

The six Power presets shown are Luna High, GPT-6 Sol Light (selected in this example), GPT-6 Sol Medium, Astra Light, Astra Medium, and Astra Extra High. Some paid plans omit Astra Extra High. Advanced controls are illustrative; available options and defaults vary by plan, client, workspace settings, and rollout.

## Choosing a model

Choose **Astra** when a task needs the strongest capability across steps and tools. **GPT-6.1 Sol** offers near-Astra performance at a lower cost than Astra. Use **GPT-6.1 Sol** when available to your account and client, and **Luna** for clear, repeatable tasks.

### Where each model shines

- **Astra, for the hardest end-to-end work.** Choose Astra for complete workflows across code, apps, and research that need sustained reasoning and judgment. Give it the sources, templates, constraints, and checks that define a useful result. Astra is better at asking focused questions and incorporating your guidance while keeping the original goal and constraints in view.
- **GPT-6.1 Sol, for repeated, long-running work.** Consider GPT-6.1 Sol for work across code, apps, and documents when cost matters. Keep Astra for your most demanding work.
- **Luna, for clear, repeatable tasks.** Choose Luna for specific, high-volume tasks when you know what a good result looks like, such as extraction, classification, transformation, and structured summaries.

### Pick a reasoning effort

For GPT-6.1 Sol, start with the reasoning effort available by default in your client and adjust based on the task. Start with **High** for Luna or **Light** for Astra. In configuration, Astra’s Light setting is `low`. Increase the effort for tasks that need more planning, analysis, or checking.

- **Light** in the ChatGPT desktop app, ChatGPT Work on the web, and IDE extension, or **Low** in the CLI, suits quick, well-scoped tasks.
- **Medium** balances speed and depth for tasks that need more planning.
- **High** and **Extra High** suit difficult work with multiple steps, sources, or tradeoffs.

Reasoning efforts don’t map exactly between model generations. Try a familiar task at a lower setting and adjust based on the result.

### Know when to use Max or Ultra

**Max** gives the selected model more time to reason about a single task. Use it for the hardest problems, when depth matters more than speed or usage. If you don’t see Max in the ChatGPT desktop app, check your app settings.

**Ultra** uses [subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents) to handle separate parts of a complex task in parallel. Choose it when you can divide the work into meaningful parts. Most tasks do not need Max or Ultra.

GPT-6 Luna supports reasoning efforts up to **Max**, but not **Ultra**.

In the CLI, use `/model`, choose a model, then select **More reasoning…** to see its supported Max or Ultra options.

If your model supports Ultra but it doesn’t appear in the desktop app’s model slider, go to **Settings** > **Configuration**, then turn on **Ultra in model picker slider**.

## Other models

When you sign in with ChatGPT, Codex works best with the recommended models listed above.

For a custom model provider or gateway, use a compatible Responses API endpoint. See [Custom model providers](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-advanced#custom-model-providers) for configuration and [Gateway compatibility](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/gateway-compatibility) for streaming, tool, and conversation requirements. Current Codex releases don’t support `wire_api = "chat"` or a Chat Completions-only endpoint.

## Deprecated Codex models

GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark retired on September 14, 2026, and is no longer available in the ChatGPT desktop app, Codex CLI, or IDE extension. Update saved configurations, custom agents, and scripts that select `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` to use an [available model](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models#recommended-models). See the [Spark retirement notice](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/changelog#codex-2026-09-14-codex-spark-deprecation).

GPT-5.5 retires from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in on October 14, 2026. Replace `gpt-5.5` with a model available to your account and client. See [GPT-5.5 retirement](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models#gpt-55-retirement) for plan-specific replacements and the migration checklist.

The `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` models retired from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in on August 31, 2026. Replace `gpt-5.4` with `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-5.4-mini` with `gpt-6-luna` when available to your plan and client. In Enterprise and Edu, an administrator must enable Luna first. Update workspace defaults, saved model settings, managed configurations, custom agents, and scheduled tasks with an available replacement.

The `gpt-5.2` and `gpt-5.3-codex` models are already deprecated in Codex when you sign in with ChatGPT. Update scripts, configuration files, and `codex exec --model` commands that still reference those models.

The OpenAI API and Codex authenticated with your own API key aren’t affected by the GPT-5.4 retirement. For current API model availability, see the [API models page](https://learn.chatgpt.com/api/docs/models).

## Configure your default local model

The ChatGPT desktop app, Codex CLI, and IDE extension use the same `config.toml` [configuration file](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-basic). To specify a model, add a `model` entry to your configuration file. If you don’t specify a model, the ChatGPT desktop app, Codex CLI, or IDE extension uses a recommended model.

```toml
model = "gpt-6.1-sol"
```
