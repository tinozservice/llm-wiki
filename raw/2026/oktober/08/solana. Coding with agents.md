## Using Solana MCP

The most powerful way to leverage AI for Solana development is through the [Solana Developer MCP](https://mcp.solana.com/) (Model Context Protocol). This integration brings specialized Solana knowledge directly into your IDE, giving your agents access to up-to-date Solana documentation and making development faster and more efficient.

## What is Solana MCP?

Solana MCP is a specialized AI assistant that integrates directly into AI-supported IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. When you ask Solana-specific questions, it automatically queries the MCP server to provide accurate, up-to-date information from:

- The [Solana documentation](https://solana.com/docs)
- The [Anchor Framework documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs)
- Solana [Program Examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples)
- [Solana Stack Exchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com/) questions and answers

## Example use cases

You can use MCP to:

- Ask about Solana concepts
- Debug program errors
- Get best-practice recommendations
- Learn from expert examples
- Develop faster with the help of an expert

## Set up Solana MCP

Find a detailed setup and getting started guide on the [Solana MCP website](https://mcp.solana.com/).

## Prefer to use a skill?

If you'd rather use a skill, install the official Solana skill with:

```shellscript
npx skills add https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill
```

Browse more reusable workflows in the [Solana Agent Skills library](https://solana.com/skills).
